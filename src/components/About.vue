      As an engineer, I aim to build beautiful, responsive, and 
      accessible web applications and software. Using well written code and modern technologies, I work to solve real world problems. I use data to build predictive models, exploratory data analyses (EDA), and strong visualizations.  As a tech writer, I aim to make high level concepts understandable to both technologist and non-technologist audiences.  
      <br><br>
      I have a degree in Mathematics from Bryn Mawr College with Latin Honors. 
      <br><br>
      Outside of work, I love traveling and learning more about the world! <br>
